# Backend Beginner Projects

This repository contains a collection of beginner-level backend projects implemented in C#. Through these projects, I practiced and improved my understanding of core C# concepts such as methods, functions, classes, and object-oriented programming (OOP) by creating simple console applications.

##  Projects Overview

| Project Name              | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Banking System**         | Simulates basic banking operations (e.g., deposits, withdrawals, account balance). |
| **Currency Converter**     | Converts amounts between two currencies using fixed or user-defined rates. |
| **Number Guessing Game**   | A console game where the user tries to guess a randomly chosen number.     |
| **Quiz Application**       | Presents quiz questions and evaluates user input to calculate a score.     |
| **To-Do List**             | Allows users to add, display, and remove simple to-do items via console.   |
| **User Auth System**       | Demonstrates basic user authentication logic, possibly using simple credential checks or in-memory user storage. |

##  Learning & Experience Gained

- Solidified knowledge of C# basics: syntax, data types, operators, and control structures.
- Designed and implemented different methods (functions), including parameter passing and return values.
- Embraced object-oriented thinking: defined classes, encapsulated behavior, and organized logic in methods.
- Learned how to structure projects: organizing code into separate classes, modules, or filesâ€”even in simple console apps.
- Built confidence in debugging, reading code, and iteratively improving my logic.
